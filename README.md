# mapreduce-templates

Includes Sample MapReduce projects implemented for data analysis purposes.

## Usage
Each folder contains a standalone Hadoop project with the data that was used in the analysis project.   
See individual projects for details on compiling project files and running the mapreduce tasks.

## Requirements
- Apache Hadoop
- Dataproc cluster (recommended)  

Note: While Hadoop offers single-node in a pseudo-distributed mode, it is highly recommended to run these projects on a dataproc cluster with Hadoop pre-installed, see [GCP Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc?hl=en).


## Executing
See individual projects for detailed instructions (WIP)
